            Many people go their entire lives without finding something that they're 
        truly passionate about, something that truly inspires them. I was fortunate to 
        find that with climbing at a reasonablye early age, when I was 21 back in 2017. 
        Funnily enough, it was actually the MIT PE graduation requirement that led me
        to discover climbing. There was an option to take a class at a local 
        gym (MetroRock) that fulfilled the requirement, I signed up, and the rest is 
        history. 
        <br></br>
            I have Youtube channel where I upload various outdoor and indoor climbs.
            It started back in 2020 when I was trying a problem called 
            New Wave (V9) at my local crag, Mortar Rock. There were no videos of anyone doing the
            problem and it seemed completely impossible. I realized there was a niche to be filled
            so I resolved to do the problem and capture it on video. If you're a climber
            as well, I hope my videos can be of use on your journey!
